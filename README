The Lua and Moonscript versions have the most features, which are callable from the command line. All versions take the option -h to view command line usage.
You'll need to run these from the directory where the dictionary "dict" is located (or copy the dict file to the correct directory.) This file is a file with one word per line.

randompassword.lua - This is the Lua version. Runs with Lua 5.1 or 5.2 (including luajit.) It optionally requires luasocket, but the random seed may not be portable without luasocket.
randompassword.moon - This is the most recent version written in Moonscript. It optionally requires luasockt, but the random seed may not be portable withouth luasocket.
randompassword.php - This is the command line launcher for the PHP version that accepts a single argument
randomWordPassword.php - This is the minimal PHP version. It was the first attempt at this and the most basic
